## All about coding

### **What is coding?**
Coding is a way for a person to give a computer instructions it can understand. Coding can take many forms. These are called languages. *Each coding language has a different syntax and has its own pros and cons*. Coding languages were developed so people can more easily understand the instructions they are giving the computer. The computer only understands binary which is 1's and 0's. A coding language allows us to write a set of instructions and then those instructions are converted into binary so a machine can understand them. 


### **Common coding languages**
#### These are some of the most widely used coding languages today
+ Python
+ Javascript
+ HTML
+ Java
+ C
+ C++
+ C#

### Coding languages can be divided into two categories:
#### + High Level Language 
#### + Low Level Language
High level languages are languages that are easily understood by people such as python or java and must be translated to a low level language to be undertsood by a machine using a compiler or an interpreter.

A low level language is difficult for people to understand and is made to be read by a computer. These would be assembly language or machine code. Low level languages may also need a assembler, compiler or interpreter to be read by machines, however, these languages are much closer to a readable state by a machine than by a person


| Language      | Level |
| Python        | High level language |
| Java          | High Level Language |
| Javascript    | High Level Language |
| C             | High Level Language |
| HTML          | High Level Language |
| C++           | High Level Language |
| C#            | High Level Language |
| Assembly      | Low Level Language  |
| Machine/Binary| Low Level Language  |

### What does a simple program look like?
A simple program that every coder starts out with is the Hello World program. Depending on the language you are using the code may look different. 

#### This program looks like this in python:

```
def main():
    print("Hello World!")
main()
```

#### This program looks like this in C
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   printf("Hello World!");
   return 0;
}
```

As you can see these programs both have the same output of "Hello World!", however their syntax is different.
