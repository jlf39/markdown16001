# *Compilers and Interpreters*


## __What is a compiler?__
A compiler translates code written in a high level language into machine code. 
The compiler does this once before the program runs. Compilers are very common
and widely used in the coding community. Compiled code runs fast, displays errors 
once the code is run, and is based on the translation linking loading model.

## __What is an interpreter?__
An interpreter is very similar to a compiler in the sense that it converts a high
level language into a low level language. However, it does this quite differently
than a compiler. An interpreter converts high level code into machine code but it does
this one line at a time while the program runs. Interpreter code runs slower than Compiled
code and displays the errors one line at a time
